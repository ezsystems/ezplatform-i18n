## Introduction

This is a meta repository that centralizes Ibexa translations to ease synchronization with Crowdin.

**Important** : This repository is not supposed to be used on a production project, each translation will be 
split into a dedicated package.

## Crowdin

If you want to help us translate Ibexa Open Source, feel free to contribute on the [Ibexa project on Crowdin][crowdin-ezplatform].

### In context translation

You can enable [Crowdin in context translation][in-context] by setting a specific cookie on an Ibexa application.

One way to do this is to open the development console (right click, inspect) and run these lines:

**Enable :**

    document.cookie='ez_in_context_translation=1;path=/;'; location.reload();
    
**Disable :** 

    document.cookie='ez_in_context_translation=;expires=Mon, 05 Jul 2000 00:00:00 GMT;path=/;'; location.reload();
